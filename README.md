# ContractsManagement

Throughout the development of this project, I had the opportunity to further refine my C++ skills and deepen my understanding of key concepts, such as memory management, the Rule of Three and Five, RAII, and smart pointers. <br>
I also applied Object-Oriented Programming principles and design patterns like Observer and Model-View-Controller (MVC), while gaining hands-on experience with iterators and templates by implementing part of the 'vector' class from the C++ Standard Library. <br>
Additionally, I explored GUI development using Qt, working with signals and slots to create a robust user interface. <br>

The main window provides an intuitive interface for managing, filtering, and sorting disciplines based on various attributes. <br>

The Contracts tab, easily accessible with a single click, allows users to add disciplines, create custom contracts, include a specified number of random disciplines, and export the contract as an HTML file. <br>

Additionally, dynamic buttons are provided for each professor, displaying additional information upon selection. If a professor does not teach any courses, their information is removed. This behavior is demonstrated in the following scenario, which also showcases the undo functionality, allowing for unlimited consecutive undos. <br>

When a discipline is deleted, the corresponding button disappears. <br>

By using the undo functionality, both the discipline and the associated button reappear. <br>
